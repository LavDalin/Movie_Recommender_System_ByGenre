# Movie_Recommender_System_ByGenre
A recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which challenges to assume the priorities of a user, and make recommendations on the basis of userâ€™s priorities. Recommendation systems help users find and select items (e.g., books, movies, restaurants) from the huge number available on the web or in other electronic information sources.

Here we are using Content Based Filtering to create a Recommener system that will movies based on the similarity between the content (e.g., genres, directors, actors) of the movies a user has already liked and the content of new movies. It uses movie features instead of user preferences, focusing on matching items based on their properties.
